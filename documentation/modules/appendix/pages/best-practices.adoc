[[best-practices]]
= Best Practices
:nok-small: icon:times-circle[role="red",size="1x"]
:ok-small: icon:check-circle[role="green",size="1x"]

The following best practices, while not mandatory, are highly recommended for optimal performance and to mitigate potential issues, especially when working with Aspect Models at scale.

[[the-name-attribute]]
== The `name` attribute

The `name` attribute is mandatory for all model elements.

Use camel-case capitalization, as detailed in the xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#naming-rules[naming rules].

For optimal results, consider the following best practices:

* <<camel-case-for-acronyms>>
* <<unmistakable-abbreviations>>
* <<no-redundant-prefix>>
* <<no-redundant-suffix>>
* <<meaningful-names>>
* <<add-payload-names-for-properties>>
* <<if-certain-characteristics-are-present>>

In addition to that, there are also best practices for:

* <<the-preferredname-attribute>>
* <<the-description-attribute>>

[[camel-case-for-acronyms]]
=== Camel case for acronyms

For every part of a `name`, also for acronyms, strictly apply camel-case capitalization as detailed in the  xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#naming-rules[naming rules].

For example:

|===
|{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|`mainECU`
|`mainEcu`
|`plantID`
|`plantId`
|`documentURL`
|`documentUrl`
|===

Create `name` attributes where each capital letter can be trusted to trigger the start of a new name part.

That way, for example, automated case conversion will produce meaningful names (e.g., when generating code based on an Aspect Model):

|===
|SAMM `name` |Resulting name in generated code (automated case conversion)

|{nok-small} `documentURL`
|`DOCUMENT_U_R_L` {nok-small}
|{ok-small} `documentUrl`
|`DOCUMENT_URL` {ok-small}
|===

[[unmistakable-abbreviations]]
=== Unmistakable abbreviations

Avoid abbreviations that are not sufficiently common.
Seemingly obvious abbreviations in one context can be misunderstood in different contexts.

For example:

|===
|{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|`temp`
|Abbreviation unclear; not recommended. (Could mean "temperature" or "temporary".)
|Abbreviating “minimum” or “maximum” by `min` or `max` is common enough and, therefore, acceptable.
|`minTemperature` +
`maxSpeed`
|===

Using unmistakable abbreviations also applies to <<abbreviations-in-descriptions,Description texts>>.

[[no-redundant-prefix]]
=== No redundant prefix

Do not duplicate information.

Avoid prefixes that repeat a domain (the namespace) an Aspect Model belongs to.

|===
|{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|`fooCount` +
`fooId` +
`fooXyz` +
etc. +
&nbsp; +
Complete identifier of such a Property: +
`urn:samm:foo.myapplication:1.0.0#fooCount`
|`count` +
`id` +
`xyz` +
etc. +
&nbsp; +
Complete identifier of such a Property: +
`urn:samm:foo.myapplication:1.0.0#count`
|===

NOTE: The complete identifier of a Property is the versioned namespace combined with the element's `name`, for example, `urn:samm:foo.myapplication:1.0.0#count`.
So, the `foo` context (namespace) is already part of `count`&#8203;'s identifier.

[[no-redundant-suffix]]
=== No redundant suffix

Do not duplicate information.

Avoid suffixes that repeat the SAMM model element type, such as Aspect, Property, etc.

|===
|{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|`MovementAspect` +
&nbsp; +
Result in TTL file: +
`:MovementAspect a samm:Aspect ;`
|`Movement` +
&nbsp; +
Result in TTL file: +
`:Movement a samm:Aspect ;`
|===

TIP: To distinguish between, for example, an Entity and a related Characteristic, it is acceptable to add corresponding suffixes.

[[meaningful-names]]
=== Meaningful names (reduce technical debt)

Choose meaningful names for your model elements to foster reuseability and avoid technical debt.

That means:

* Do not simply mirror Property names from data sources like API responses (e.g., JSON).
** Might be convenient in the short term
** But makes it difficult to understand and reuse the model in the future
* Invest the time upfront to choose descriptive names that reflect the purpose and meaning of each element.

TIP: Meaningful names improve code readability and maintainability, whereas arbitrary names make understanding and modifying the model harder in the long run.

Regarding meaningfulness, see also the details given for the `description` attribute at <<no-repeated-preferredname>>.

[[add-payload-names-for-properties]]
=== Payload names for Properties

An expressive Property `name` can be long.

If you consider a Property's name too long for the runtime payload, xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#payload-names[add a payload name].

NOTE: Do not rename Properties just for the sake of a short runtime payload.

[[if-certain-characteristics-are-present]]
=== If certain Characteristics are present in a "Collection Aspect"

An Aspect with exactly one Property on root level which holds a Collection Characteristic can be perceived as a "Collection Aspect".
Data sets provided by such an Aspect may be very large.
This also applies to other Characteristics, i.e., the List, Set, Sorted Set, and Time Series Characteristics.

For a "Collection Aspect", consider the following naming advice for the Property itself and for the corresponding Aspect.

|===
|Characteristic held by Property|How to name the Property |How to name the Aspect

|xref:ROOT:characteristics.adoc#collection-characteristic[Collection] Characteristic
|Name the Property `items`.
|Put the Aspect's name in *plural*.

|xref:ROOT:characteristics.adoc#list-characteristic[List] Characteristic
|Name the Property `items`.
|Put the Aspect's name in *plural*.

|xref:ROOT:characteristics.adoc#set-characteristic[Set] Characteristic
|Name the Property `items`.
|Put the Aspect's name in *plural*.

|xref:ROOT:characteristics.adoc#sorted-set-characteristic[Sorted Set] Characteristic
|Name the Property `items`.
|Put the Aspect's name in *plural*.

|xref:ROOT:characteristics.adoc#time-series-characteristic[Time Series] Characteristic
|Name the Property `items`.
|Put the Aspect's name in *singular* and add a `History` suffix to it.
|===

[[the-preferredname-attribute]]
== The `preferredName` attribute

The `preferredName` attribute is available for all model elements.

For more information, refer to xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#attributes-that-all-model-elements-have[Attributes that all model elements have].

For optimal results, consider the following best practices:

* <<precise-and-understandable>>
* <<separate-words>>
* <<no-article>>
* <<capitalization-as-in-dictionary>>

In addition to that, there are also best practices for:

* <<the-name-attribute>>
* <<the-description-attribute>>

[[precise-and-understandable]]
=== Precise and understandable

The `preferredName` attribute is meant to provide a human-readable name.

Choose a Preferred Name that is precise and easy to understand.

[TIP]
====
People might encounter the Preferred Name, for example:

* As a user of an Aspect Model--in documentation generated from the Aspect Model
* As a user of a software solution--in a user interface of an application that was built based on the Aspect Model
====

[[separate-words]]
=== Separate words

Should you copy and paste an element's `name` to use it as the `preferredName`, adapt it accordingly.

For example, if the `name` consists of more than one word, written in camel case, separate it into the respective words.

.Examples of Preferred Names derived from the `name` attributes of the model elements
[source,turtle,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
:plantId a samm:Property ;
   samm:preferredName "plant ID"@en ;

:machineTmperature a samm:Property ;
   samm:preferredName "machine temperature"@en ;

:euTaxonomyDisclosureStatement a samm:Property ;
   samm:preferredName "EU taxonomy disclosure statement"@en ;

:ttlFileName a samm:Property ;
   samm:preferredName "TTL file name"@en ;
----

[[no-article]]
=== No article

While an article and a noun can be combined, they do not automatically _belong_ together.

Therefore, avoid articles in Preferred Names.

|===
|{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|the machine temperature +
a machine temperature
|machine temperature
|===

[[capitalization-as-in-dictionary]]
=== Capitalization: as in dictionary

Apply dictionary-style wording.

That means:

* Do not apply any artificial capitalization.
* Put the words as they would be listed in a dictionary.

NOTE: In English, capital letters are reserved for *proper nouns*.

A term such as "engine control unit":

* *Is not a proper noun.* Therefore, following the dictionary, it is written in lowercase: _engine control unit_.
* *May have an acronym,* such as "ECU" for _engine control unit_. +
If required in a Preferred Name, an acronym ("ECU") remains in capital letters: _engine control unit (ECU)_.

For example:

|===
|{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|`Engine Control Unit (ECU)` +
`Engine control unit (ECU)` +
|`engine control unit (ECU)`
|`plant Id` +
`Plant ID` +
`Plant Id`
|`plant ID`
|`ttl file name` +
`TTL File Name`
|`TTL file name`
|`EU Taxonomy Disclosure Statement` +
`EU Taxonomy disclosure statement`
|`EU taxonomy disclosure statement`
|`Machine Temperature` +
`Machine temperature`
|`machine temperature`
|`Allow Duplicates` +
`Allow duplicates` +
|`allow duplicates`
|===

Examples with proper nouns:

|===
|{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|`Planned September Batch`
|`planned September batch`
|`Monday Delivery Report`
|`Monday delivery report`
|===

For languages other than English, the same practice applies: put the words for the Preferred Name as they would be listed in a dictionary.

For example, in German:

|===
|{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|`Maschinen-Temperatur` +
`die Maschinentemperatur`
|`Maschinentemperatur`
|`Erlaube Duplikate` +
|`erlaube Duplikate`
|===

*Rationale:* By using words the same way they would be listed in a dictionary, the `preferredName` attribute is flexible to be used in further applications, for example:

* To complete an orthographically correct sentence, e.g., in a pop-up message within a user interface. +
(The Preferred Name can be *used as-is*.)
* To stand alone, e.g., to appear as a tooltip in a user interface. +
(The Preferred Name can be *parsed towards* the desired capitalization style--sentence case or title case.)

NOTE: Once a Preferred Name is artificially capitalized--whether in sentence case or title case--it can't be reverted (parsed back) to its dictionary form.
This is because the applied capitalization obscures proper nouns.

[[the-description-attribute]]
== The `description` attribute

The `description` attribute is available for all model elements.

For more information, refer to xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#attributes-that-all-model-elements-have[Attributes that all model elements have].

For optimal results, consider the following best practices:

* <<capitalization-start-uppercase>>
* <<punctuation-end-with-period>>
* <<comprehensible-concise>>
* <<no-repeated-preferredname>>
* <<abbreviations-in-descriptions>>
* <<no-brand-names>>
* <<no-entity-property>>
* <<no-this-preferred-name>>
* <<no-the>>
* <<triple-quotes>>
* <<keep-indentation>>
* <<new-line>>
* <<markdown-where-needed>>
* <<lists-markdown>>
* <<notes-markdown>>
* <<examples-markdown>>
* <<sources-markdown>>
* <<markdown-blockquote-summary>>

In addition to that, there are also best practices for:

* <<the-name-attribute>>
* <<the-preferredname-attribute>>

[[capitalization-start-uppercase]]
=== Capitalization: start uppercase

A `description` consists of at least a few words forming a phrase or a sentence fragment.

Start with an uppercase letter.

For example:

|===
|{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|flag indicating whether the asset is currently moving
|Flag indicating whether the asset is currently moving.
|represents a single position in space with optional z coordinate
|Represents a single position in space with optional z coordinate.
|Signifies the Vertical Distance in Reference to a Historic Mean Sea Level as a Vertical Datum
|Signifies the vertical distance in reference to a historic mean sea level as a vertical datum.
|===

[[punctuation-end-with-period]]
=== Punctuation: end with a period

End your `description` with a period (full stop).

Even though it is just a sentence fragment.

|===
|Example model element |{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

//SOURCE: locations.ttl
|Property `houseNumber`
|Number of a building in a street##&nbsp;##
|Number of a building in a street.
|===

[[comprehensible-concise]]
=== Writing style: comprehensible, concise

Apply a neutral writing style that is *easy to understand*.
This fosters the usability and reuseability of an Aspect Model.

Also, be *concise*.
To get an idea, think of definitions in an IEC/ISO glossary.

[[no-repeated-preferredname]]
=== Meaningful: do not just repeat the `preferredName`

Write a meaningful Description.
It can consist of only a sentence fragment, or it may be longer—but do not just repeat the Preferred Name for the Description.

|===
|Example model element |{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

//SOURCE: plant.ttl
|Property `productFamily`
|Product family.
|Set of products sharing similar features.
|===

Regarding meaningfulness, see also the details given for the `name` attribute at <<meaningful-names>>.

[[abbreviations-in-descriptions]]
=== Unmistakable abbreviations

Use abbreviations sparingly.

Only use very common standard abbreviations; ensure they are not misleading.
See also the details provided for the `name` attribute: <<unmistakable-abbreviations>>.

It is acceptable to use editorial abbreviations such as `e.g.` ("for example") or `i.e.` ("that is") or `etc.` ("and so forth").

[[no-brand-names]]
=== No brand names

Where possible, avoid brand, product, or company names in Descriptions.
This fosters reuseability of shared Aspect Models.

[[no-entity-property]]
=== No "Entity", "Property", etc.

SAMM model element terms like Entity, Property, Aspect, etc. do not belong in the Description.

NOTE: Descriptions must be understandable without knowledge of SAMM.

*Rationale:* An Aspect Model may be converted to a different output format or modeling language in which SAMM model elements are unknown.
Users unfamiliar with SAMM might find the SAMM terminology confusing.

For example:

|===
|Example model element |{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO
//SOURCE: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.generic.digital_product_passport/5.0.0/DigitalProductPassport.ttl
|Entity `Identification`
|[.underline]#Entity# with identification information of the product with part type information, local identifiers, other codes, and the data carrier.
|Identification information about the product with part-type information, local identifiers, other codes, and the data carrier.

|===

TIP: If you need to mention [.underline]#other# Properties etc. in the Description, refer to them by their `preferredName`.

[[no-this-preferred-name]]
=== No "This <preferredName> ..."

Do not start the Description with "This <preferredName> ..." as this duplicates information.

It could even interfere with further usages of the Description, for example, when displayed together with the Preferred Name in a user interface.

TIP: Start the Description as if it was a sentence fragment that would complete a sentence like "This model element is a/the ..." or just "This model element ...".

For example:

|===
|Example model element |{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

//SOURCE: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.week_based_material_demand/3.0.0/WeekBasedMaterialDemand.ttl
a|Property `materialDemandId` +
{nbsp} +
Preferred Name: `Material Demand ID`
|[.underline]#The Material Demand ID# uniquely identifies the material demand within the business relationship between a customer and its supplier
|Uniquely identifies the material demand within the business relationship between a customer and its supplier.
|===

[[no-the]]
=== No "The ..."

Avoid starting the Description with an article (where possible).

|===
|Example model element |{nok-small} DON'T |{ok-small} DO

|Property `altitude`
|[.underline]#The# elevation above sea level zero.
|Elevation above sea level zero.
|===

[[triple-quotes]]
=== Triple quotes in TTL file

Use the TTL triple quotes operator to mark the Description as a section with line breaks.

This avoids having long Descriptions sitting on just one line.
Description sections with line breaks are easier to grasp for human readers when skimming through TTL files.

See also: <<new-line>>.

.Example: Use triple quotes
[source,turtle,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
:TrafficLight a samm-c:Enumeration ;
   samm:preferredName "warning level"@en ;
   ##samm:description """##
      Represents speed of position change.
      Within specification, it turns green.
      Within tolerance, it turns yellow.
      Outside specification, it turns red.
      ##"""@en ;##
   samm:dataType xsd:string ;
   samm-c:values ( "green" "yellow" "red" ) .
----

[[keep-indentation]]
=== Indentation in TTL file

Indent the Description content given within the triple quotes.
See also <<triple-quotes>>.

Use the three-blank indentation of SAMM Turtle (TTL) files.

.Example: Stick to SAMM's three-blank indentation
[source,turtle,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
:TrafficLight a samm-c:Enumeration ;
##   ##samm:preferredName "warning level"@en ;
   samm:description """
   ##   ##Represents speed of position change.
   ##   ##Within specification, it turns green.
   ##   ##Within tolerance, it turns yellow.
   ##   ##Outside specification, it turns red.
      """@en ;
   samm:dataType xsd:string ;
   samm-c:values ( "green" "yellow" "red" ) .
----

[[new-line]]
=== New sentence, new line

Stick to the general best practice of starting every sentence on a new line.

With *one sentence per line*, any changes to a sentence will be treated on sentence level (instead of paragraph level) when working with TTL files and Git.

[[markdown-where-needed]]
=== Markdown where needed

Optionally, use Markdown (CommonMark) to:

* <<lists-markdown, List items>> in:
** Ordered lists
** Unordered lists
* Highlight paragraphs such as:
** <<notes-markdown, Notes>>
** <<examples-markdown, Examples>>
** <<sources-markdown, Sources>>
** For a quick overview, see <<markdown-blockquote-summary>>.

[[notes-markdown]]
=== Add notes (Markdown)

To add one or more notes within the `description` attribute, use the Markdown blockquote syntax.

=== Provide examples (Markdown)

To provide examples within the `description` attribute, use the Markdown blockquote syntax.

TIP: Use *EXAMPLE:* as a prefix. +
(While not required by Markdown, this practice helps distinguish notes, examples, and sources in Aspect Models.)

*When to use?* An "example" details one or more specific examples for a definition or explanation that was given before.

[[markdown-blockquote-summary]]
=== Markdown blockquote summary

The following table indicates how to employ the Markdown blockquote syntax to convey notes, examples, and sources within the `description` attribute.

|===
|Markdown syntax |Recommended prefix |Example

|`>`
|`NOTE:`
|`> NOTE: This provides further information that also needs some extra attention, which is why such a piece of information is highlighted as a "note".`

|`>`
|`EXAMPLE:`
|`> EXAMPLE: This details an example for a given definition.`

|`>`
|`SOURCE:`
|`> SOURCE: This acknowledges a source that was cited in the Description--optionally including a [link](https://www.example.com).`

|===

How to use the Markdown blockquote syntax:

* Explicitly start each line with the `>` character. (Recommended)
* To add more content after the blockquote element, add a blank line after the blockquote element. (Required)

TIP: All Markdown blockquote elements--notes, examples, and sources--can contain URLs in Markdown notation.

[[choosing-a-numeric-type]]
== Choosing a Numeric Type

While JSON only distinguishes between _number_ (floating point) and _integer_, the
xref:ROOT:datatypes.adoc#data-types[type hierarchy] for Aspect Models provides many more options. There
is a distinction between the numeric core types (`xsd:integer` and the fixed-point type
`xsd:decimal`) and the limited range numbers that correspond to the numeric types as defined in most
programming languages (`xsd:float` and `xsd:double` as well as the integer types `xsd:int`,
`xsd:short` etc.).

IMPORTANT: As an Aspect Model ideally captures as much of the domain semantics as possible, it
should not limit itself according to implementation-specific restrictions. In particular, limited
range numbers should only be used when the semantics of the numeric range are relevant beyond the
implementation of the Aspect. For example, a Property `temperature` of a sensor could use a limited
range type such as `xsd:int`, when the physical sensor can never provide a value outside of this
range, while a Property such as `numberOfProducedItems` is not logically limited, so it should use
`xsd:integer`.

[[choosing-a-unit]]
== Choosing a Unit

When trying to refer to a physical unit, please see the xref:appendix:unitcatalog.adoc[Unit
Catalog]. When searching for the unit, remember that the unit catalog uses British English, e.g.,
_metre_ instead of _meter_.

TIP: If you're modeling quantities for which both the metric system and the imperial system provide
units, such as meter vs. feet, it is always recommended to use the metric system (preferably SI units
like meter or others like kilometer if more common in the domain) – unless there are specific
reasons to create the model differently. In any case, it is strongly discouraged to add multiple
Properties in the same scope representing the same value but only using different units due to the
inherent complexity.

[[choosing-a-characteristic]]
== Choosing a Characteristic

The following decision tree helps to find the right Characteristic for a Property.

IMPORTANT: A common error is using the `Text` Characteristic for anything resembling a string.
`Text` is intended for values that are meant _only_ for humans, for example, a description of a
device that is entered by a user as free text. Values such as identifiers, hostnames, table names,
license plate numbers etc. should not use the `Text` Characteristic.

If you create Characteristics that are not limited to your modeled domain but are generally useful,
please consider contributing them so that they can be included in the {meta-model-full-name}'s
Characteristic catalog.

image::characteristics-decision-tree.svg[width=100%]

[[choosing-constraints]]
== Choosing Constraints

Constraints are used to precisely specify limiting conditions of Characteristics. It is recommended
to use Constraints thoroughly:

. It makes the intent of the respective Property clear for humans reading the model or documentation
generated from the model.
. It allows tooling to generate code for the Aspect that can take the Constraints into account. Validation code corresponding to the Constraints can be directly inserted, thus reducing manual implementation effort.

The following decision tree helps to find matching Constraints for a Characteristic. Note that
multiple Constraints can be combined.

CAUTION: If and only if the value has a xref:ROOT:datatypes.adoc#data-types[string-like value space] and
does _not_ use UTF-8 as an encoding, use an xref:ROOT:characteristics.adoc#encoding-constraint[Encoding
Constraint] for the Property. This will ensure that consumers of the Aspect will not end up with
broken special characters.

image::constraints-decision-tree.svg[width=100%]

[[reusing-elements]]
== Reusing Elements

It is generally advisable to reuse definitions of existing model elements that describe the desired semantics. This not only ensures efficiency
and maintainability but, more importantly, it explicitly expresses that the model builds upon a set of agreed-upon abstractions.
The reuse of existing model element definitions makes it clear that your model talks about _the same thing_. On the other hand,
introducing another definition of an allegedly already existing concept is equivalent to stating that the deliberately newly created definition
does indeed mean something different. This is particularly useful when model elements are created for terminology that can have many different
meanings in various contexts, such as the term "process".

`xref:ROOT:entities.adoc#entities[Entities]`,
`xref:ROOT:characteristics.adoc#characteristics[Characteristics]`,
`xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#declaring-events[Events]`,
`xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#declaring-constraints[Constraints]`, and
`xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#declaring-properties[Properties]` are fundamental components of an Aspect.
Reusing these elements across different Aspects ensures consistency, reduces redundancy, and simplifies the management and
integration of shared attributes and interactions.

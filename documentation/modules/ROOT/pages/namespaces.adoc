[[meta-model-identifiers-definition]]
== Meta Model Identifiers Definition

Identifiers for elements of the meta model _must_ use the URN syntax
xref:samm-specification:appendix:bibliography.adoc#rfc2141[[rfc2141\]] and the following schema:

....
urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:<element-type>:<version>#<element-name>
....

where the variable parts are interpreted as follows:

* *element-type* -- a selector describing the kind of thing the URN describes, _must_ be one of:
** `meta-model` - For meta model elements
** `characteristic` - For Characteristics and Constraints that are defined in the scope of the meta model
** `entity` - For Entities that are defined inside the scope of the meta model
** `unit` - For the xref:units.adoc#units[catalog of units and quantity kinds]
* *version* -- The version of the respective namespace, _must_ be given in the form "X.Y.Z", with X,
   Y and Z being integers.
* *element-name* -- The name of the model element

*Examples for valid meta model URNs:*

* `{samm}Aspect` -- URN of the `Aspect` concept in Meta Model version {meta-model-version}
* `{samm-c}Measurement` -- URN of the
  xref:characteristics.adoc#measurement-characteristic[Measurement] Characteristic in Meta Model version {meta-model-version}
* `{samm-e}Point3D` -- URN of the
  xref:entities.adoc#point-3d[Point 3D] entity
* `{unit}kilogram` -- URN of the xref:appendix:unitcatalog.adoc#unit-kilogram[Kilogram] unit

[[aspect-model-element-identifiers-definition]]
== Aspect Model Element Identifiers Definition

Identifiers of elements that are defined on the model level -- i.e., Aspects, Properties, Entities,
Operations, Characteristics, Events, Units -- _must_ use the following schema:

....
urn:samm:<namespace>:<version>#<element-name>
....

where the variable parts are interpreted as follows:

* *namespace* -- Defines the hierarchical namespace in which the element resides. This is given in
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation[Reverse Domain Name Notation]. To
   avoid confusion with the {meta-model-full-name}, this _should not_ start with
   `org.eclipse.esmf` (unless for the model elements defined by the ESMF
   project, such as those that are part of SAMM). A namespace shall always be in lowercase.
   It should also contain at least two ASCII letters and should have at least two parts. So a minimal example of a namespace would be 'io.om'.
* *version* -- The version of the respective namespace, must be given in the form "X.Y.Z", with X, Y
   and Z being integers.
* *element-name* -- The name of the element:
** For Aspects, Entities and Characteristics, the name must be given in
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case[UpperCamelCase]
** For Properties, Operations and Units, the name must be given in
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case[lowerCamelCase]

*Examples for valid URNs:*

* `urn:samm:{example-ns}:1.0.0#MyAspect` -- URN of an Aspect in the given namespace
* `urn:samm:{example-ns}:1.0.0#MyEntity` -- URN of an Entity in the given namespace
* `urn:samm:{example-ns}:1.0.0#someProperty` -- URN of a Property in the given namespace

[[prefixes]]
== Prefixes

The following rules apply to contexts that allow the use of CURIEs (Compact URI,
xref:samm-specification:appendix:bibliography.adoc#curie[[curie\]]), i.e., the shortening of URIs by
pre-defining a short name for common parts of URIs in a local context (in particular, XML namespaces
xref:samm-specification:appendix:bibliography.adoc#xmlns[[xmlns\]],
https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#sec-iri[@prefix] in RDF/Turtle
xref:samm-specification:appendix:bibliography.adoc#turtle[[turtle\]] and
https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#QSynIRI[PREFIX] in SPARQL
xref:samm-specification:appendix:bibliography.adoc#sparql[[sparql\]]):

* The prefix "samm" _must_ be used for the URN `{samm}`
* The prefix "samm-c" _must_ be used for the URN `{samm-c}`
* The prefix "samm-e" _must_ be used for the URN `{samm-e}`
* The prefix "unit" _must_ be used for the URN `{unit}`
* The empty prefix (":" in RDF/Turtle) _must_ be used for the URN prefix of the current model scope, i.e.
  everything up to and including the `#` of the model elements that are being defined
* For other elements, use prefixes that _must not_ contain the string `samm`.

*Example of Aspect Model description in RDF/Turtle, with prefix declarations and usage:*
